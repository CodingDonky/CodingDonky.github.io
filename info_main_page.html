        <h5> Brief Overview: </h5>
        <p>
        I've always wanted to make my own homebrew RPG. Ever since I fell in love
        with d&d and pathfinder, and then found myself lost in the overly complex
        combat systems that drag for hours and the limiting "character class" system
        that seems to railroad players into a handful of playstyles.
        </p>

        <p>
        I suppose the point of this system is to be what I wanted d&d to be. A totally
        open ended adventure with constant dramatic tension. PCs have 3 health bars
        to manage, giving a constant feeling of pressure. Combat is fast and
        extremely deadly. There is a huge build diversity akin to Skyrim's
        or Dark Souls' classless systems, every point in every attribute matters.
        Synergies can be explored beyond "keep major attributes high".
