        <h5> Divination: </h5>

        <p>
        To be Divine is to be more than human. Divinity is a higher power,
        something unending and ever powerful. Is Divinity a relative term then?
        If it neccessarily implies a higher power?
        </p>

        <p>
        Humanity imitates the Divinity. Their mimicry is known as
        divination. Divination used to describe attempts at viewing the future,
        but to a Divine, divination implies choosing the future. An all powerful
        being viewing their future is the same as the being choosing their future.
        </p>

        <p>
        In this system, divination refers to the discipline of studying and bending
        supernatural forces to one's will. Attempts to imitate the all-powerful
        nature of Divinity.

        <h5> Schools of the Divine: </h5>

        <p>
        Spells are seperated into nine main schools. These schools are very
        loosly based on concepts in early physics curricula as a
        differentiator between the myriad of magical systems that already
        exist. These schools are categorized into three subjects,
        Structure, Force, and Life.
        </p>

        <table style="float: left;">
          <tr>

        <p>
        Structure. It governs the common states of matter: solid, liquid, and
        gas. Geomancy governs the domain of the Earth and all things solid.
        Practitioners can transform stone at will, launch boulders, repair /
        shatter objects, and alter the physical properties of solid matter.
        Hydromancy governs the manipulation of different liquids, vapors, and
        low temperatures. Aeromancy is the control over atmospheric properties,
        pressure, Oxygen levels, and allows one to use the wind itself as a
        deadly weapon or helpful ally.
        </p>

        <p>
        Force. It governs three schools that represent different forces that
        make up our world: electromagnitism, spacetime, and the weak and strong
        forces are combined into the concept of atomic energy impartation.
        Electromancy allows one to manipulate electricity, magnetic forces, and
        light itself. Spatiomancy oversees the domain of space and time.
        Practitioners can create portals in space, summon creatures, resize
        matter, and even slow time. Pyromancy is raw, unbridled energy that
        typically manifests as fire or plasma.

        <p>
        Life. A mysterious and poorly defined phenomenon that is, nontheless,
        impossible to ignore. It is believed that all living creatures possess
        three aspects: a physical body, problem solving abilities, and
        an internal social sense that may be called charisma or even one's soul.
        The schools of life roughly follow this breakdown. Ecomancy is the
        manipulation of physical life energy including ATP production, cellular
        regeneration, and allows for management of flora as well as fauna.
        Psychomancy is the manipulation of a creature's mental faculties, many
        spells excusively deal with controlling human thought, emotion, and
        perception. Spectromancy
        </p>

        <p>
        Those who practice magic governed by the life subject are disparate
        indeed. Those who wield life magic for a noble or selfless cause will
        often demand to be referred to as Animancers to
        avoid any association with the darker side of life magic.
        Necromancers indeed are different only by name and by the spells they
        choose to wield.
