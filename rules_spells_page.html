        <h5> Divination: </h5>

        <p>
        To be Divine is to be more than human. Divinity is a higher power,
        something unending and ever powerful. Is Divinity a relative term then?
        If it neccessarily implies a higher power?
        </p>

        <p>
        Humanity imitates the Divinity. Their mimicry is known as
        divination. Divination used to describe attempts at viewing the future,
        but to a Divine, divination implies choosing the future. An all powerful
        being viewing their future is the same as the being choosing their future.
        </p>

        <p>
        In this system, divination refers to the discipline of studying and bending
        supernatural forces to one's will. Attempts to imitate the all-powerful
        nature of Divinity.

        <h5> Schools of the Divine: </h5>

        <p>
        Spells are seperated into nine main schools. These schools are very
        loosly based on concepts in early physics curricula as a
        differentiator between the myriad of magical systems that already
        exist. These schools are categorized into three subjects,
        Structure, Force, and Life.
        </p>

        <table style="float: left;">

        <p>
        Structure. It governs the common states of matter: solid, liquid, and
        gas. Geomancy governs the domain of the Earth and all things solid.
        Practitioners can transform stone at will, launch boulders, repair /
        shatter objects, and alter the physical properties of solid matter.
        Hydromancy governs the manipulation of different liquids, vapors, and
        low temperatures. Aeromancy is the control over atmospheric properties,
        pressure, Oxygen levels, and allows one to use the wind itself as a
        deadly weapon or helpful ally.
        </p>

        <p>
        Force. It governs three schools that represent different forces that
        make up our world: electromagnitism, spacetime, and the weak and strong
        forces are combined into the concept of atomic energy impartation.
        Electromancy allows one to manipulate electricity, magnetic forces, and
        light itself. Spatiomancy oversees the domain of space and time.
        Practitioners can create portals in space, summon creatures, resize
        matter, and even slow time. Pyromancy is raw, unbridled energy that
        typically manifests as fire or plasma.

        Life. A mysterious and poorly defined phenomenon that is, nontheless,
        impossible to ignore. It is believed that all living creatures possess
        three aspects: a physical body, problem solving abilities, and
        an internal social sense that may be called charisma or even one's soul.
        The schools of life roughly follow this breakdown. Ecomancy is the
        manipulation of physical life energy including ATP production, cellular
        regeneration, and allows for management of flora as well as fauna.
        Psychomancy is the manipulation of a creature's mental faculties, many
        spells excusively deal with controlling human thought, emotion, and
        perception.
        </p>

        <p>
        Those who practice magic governed by the life subject are disparate
        indeed. Those who wield life magic for a noble or selfless cause will
        often demand to be referred to as Animancers to
        avoid any association with the darker side of life magic.
        Necromancers indeed are different only by name and by the spells they
        choose to wield.

        <h5> Casters: </h5>

        <p>
        Those who practice divination are often referred to as casters. Anyone who
        can cast a spell is considered a caster. That being said, there are a
        variety of methods one can employ to cast spells.
        </p>

        <p>
        Diviners are the most common.
        </p>

        <p>
        Benders cast spells purely through movement of their body. From an outsider,
        benders appear to be dancing and performing kata. The world bends around
        them in step with their physical invocations. Full body movement is required
        to cast any spell that costs 4 or more pool points. At least one limb must
        be free to cast spells costing 3 or less pool points.
        </p>

        <p>
        Faithful cast spells through chants and hymns. They weave their power
        through spoken words, songs, and stories. Bodies of the faithful will
        often go stiffen during casting chants, preventing simultaneous movements.
        As their name suggests, faithful often cast using their faith in a greater
        power. Their chants summon the power of the one they serve.
