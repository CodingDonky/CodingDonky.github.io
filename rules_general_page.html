        <p>
        Action Points, or AP, is consistent across all player characters. All
        player characters have a maximum of 3AP, they regain 2AP at the start
        of their turn.
        </p>

        <p>
        All actions require AP to perform, unless it is considered a free action. At the
        start of an entity's turn, they regain AP equal to their APR, or Action
        Point Regeneration. You cannot possess more AP than your APM, or Action
        Point Maximum. Thus, all player characters have 3APM and 2APR.
        </p>

        <p>
        All spells and abilities have a certain number of AP required to perform
        them. If it requires more than the AP you currently possess, you are considered
        to be concentrating on the spell/ability until your next turn. If you lose
        concentration, you fail to cast the spell. To see if you are refunded your
        pool points, make an Acuity check of difficulty equal to the total pool
        cost of the spell / ability. e.g. if you fail to cast a spell worth 6 Int
        Pool Points, make an acuity check with difficulty 6. If you succeed you are
        refunded the six points. If you fail you lose all the pool points.

        <p>
        Distances are not measured exactly for the most part. To encourage more
        "theater of the mind" type play, and to discourage micromanaging specific
        distances, distances are grouped into 4 major categories. Close, Nearby,
        Medium, and Far. Some spells and abilities may rely on touch or seeing the
        subject, so these are sort of considered range categories as well.
        </p>

        <p>
        Longbows are most effective within medium range. Some bows will get damage
        bonuses if you are in nearby range or close range. Trying to aim beyond
        medium range will make the target much more difficult to hit. The difficulty
        of hitting a target increases by 1 for every range step beyond the
        nearby range.
