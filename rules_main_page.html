        Every player character possesses each of these 6 Attributes.
        A number is assigned, higher numbers represent talent in all skills
        controlled by that Attribute. A value of 3-5 is considered about
        average for most Attributes up to a realistic maximum of around 12.
        </p>
        <p>
        Attribute checks are made when your raw natural abilities are tested,
        for example you might be asked to roll a Strength check for trying to
        kick down a hardwood door. For every 3 points in an attribute, add 1d6
        to your roll. Add the remaining attribute points not used to the roll.
        You always roll at least 1d6. Consult the table below for an easy
        visualization.

          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
        Your Aspects function slightly differently. Each Aspect has an “Aspect
        Pool”, which is a number of spendable tokens possessed by your
        character. Your total Aspect Pool value is calculated by adding the
        two governed Attributes and subtracting one. For example, your Physical
        Pool would have a value equal to your Strength plus your Dexterity
        minus one.
        </p>
        <p>
        Your Physical Pool is your health point total and gets reduced as your
        body takes damage, once it goes to zero you are in critical condition.
        You can draw from your physical pool to dodge attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
        You draw from your Intellect Pool to use spells and whatnot, once it
        reaches zero you are rendered unconscious.
        </p>
        <p>
        Your Charisma Pool can be drawn from for faith based abilities and
        abilities that manipulate conversations,
        once it reaches zero you lose control of your character and the GM
        takes over temporarily. If your character has greater Faith, they
        will become spineless and lose their spirits, doing whatever their
        adversary wants. If your character has greater Ego, they will lose
        control and become irrational, often hostile to other friendly PCs.
        Draining your Charasma Pool may be extremely deadly, or it may be
        harmless depending on the situation.
        </p>

        style="float:left;width:170px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;">
        <p>
        The three Aspect Pools basically mean you have three health bars,
        and it’s almost guaranteed that every character will have a fatal
        weakness. This makes combat tense and varied. Additionally, it has
        the bonus of treating combat, conversation, and tests of wit all in
        the same way.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is a fourth pool that plays quite differently from the others.
        Your Inspiration Pool has no maximum value and no consequences for
        lowering to zero. Inspiration Pool Points are given sparingly to
        characters by the DM as a reward for nuanced, or badass character
        moments. You may spend 1 Inspiration Pool Point at any time to add a
        d6 to any one roll.

        <p>
        Reference the Attributes and Skills document for all of the skills.
      	Skills all start at the value of zero. They can be increased in various
        ways depending on a character’s natural talents, profession, training,
        and life events. Every skill is associated with a certain Attribute.
        When making a skill check, add the governing Attribute to your skill
        before making the roll. You roll in the exact same manner as you would
        for an Attribute check, consulting the table below.
        </p>
        <p>
        Before a skill check, the DM announces the difficulty of the check.
        Multiply the “difficulty” by two to get the minimum number a player
        must roll. A player may expend effort to decrease the difficulty by one
        level up to two times per skill check. Expending effort means that 1
        point from the relevant pool will be used, emblems do nothing for skill
        checks. Additionally, a different player may expend an effort of their
        own to assist the one making the skill check, lowering the difficulty
        by one level.
        </p>
        <p>
        Example: you want to jump over a large gorge, the DM says you have to
        pass an Acrobatics check with difficulty 6 since it is quite difficult.
        Your acrobatics skill is governed by the Physical Aspect, so you pick
        the higher of the two governing Attributes to use. Add the higher
        Attribute, let’s say a strength value of 7, to your acrobatics skill,
        let’s say 2, to a total of 9. Consulting the below table, a value of 9
        corresponds to rolling 3d6. The difficulty of the check is 6, meaning
        you have to roll a 12 or better with 3d6. There is less than a 50%
        chance of success, so you spend 1 Physical Pool Point to reduce the
        difficulty by 1. Your ally spends 1 Physical Pool Points to assist you
        jumping across the gorge. Now the difficulty is only 4. You need to
        roll 8 or higher with 3d6, now there is closer to a 70% chance of
        succeeding.
