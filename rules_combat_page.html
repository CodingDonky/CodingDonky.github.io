        <p>
        Combat, Conversations, and Conundrums are the three pillars of play that
        this game is designed around. All are treated the same way via the pool
        mechanic. You effectively have three healthbars that interact with these
        three concepts.
        <br>

        <p>
        Conversations and conundrums share similar mechanics with the combat system
        to encourage diverse playstyles. No longer is it absolutely necessary that
        everyone is outfitted to kill the biggest baddest beast around, doing so
        will leave gaping holes in the party's skillset.

        <h5> Combat: </h5>

        <p>
        This system is still up in the air. There are like a million ways to do it.
        </p>

        <p>
        Option 1: Every character simply has a "difficulty to hit" or DtH, which
        functions exactly as armor class does in d&d. You first make a roll using the
        combat skill. If you roll higher than the opponents DtHx2, you hit. Then
        you roll for damage, which usually relies purely on the type of weapon and
        your strength attribute.
        </p>

        <p>
        Option 2: Only PCs roll. When a PC is targetted by an incoming attack, they
        must make a choice. Do they try to dodge, block, or parry? Dodging means
        you must make an acrobatics skill check, the difficulty is a set number
        determined by the enemy's attributes and weapon. Dodging in inhibited by
        armor and also rmeoves 1AP that you would normally regenerate next turn.
        Blocking means you try to absorb all, or at least some, of the damage. You
        gain armor (functions as DR) determined as 1d6 + modifiers from armor and
        shields. Parrying is high risk high reward. You make a check, if you succeed
        then you avoid all damage and your next strike is an automatic hit. If you
        fail you are hit for full damage.
        </p>

        <p>
        Option 3: Secret third option idk.

        <h5> Conversation: </h5>

        <p>
        There are two major modals of play dring conversations. 1 - roleplay
        conversations, this subverts the need for skill checks by using the PC's
        arguments and words to move the plot along. 2 - Using social abilities to
        influence NPCs. There are spell-like abilities called social abilities
        that can influence a conversation in set ways. These abilities generally
        accomplish things that might otherwise be nearly impossible, like convincing
        a hostile guard that arresting the PCs just isn't worth the trouble. Rather
        than a long, belabored roleplay to convince the guard of this, you can
        choose to perform a "manipulation" ability for several Charisma pool points
        OR you can attempt a diplomacy check which has a chance of failure.

        <h5> Conundrums: </h5>

        <p>
        Conundrum are all the puzzles and difficult decisions you encounter during
        play. You can expend mental on thinking really really hard about things,
        potentially at the detriment of your intelligence pool. Thinking too much
        can burn out your brain after all, you will lose consciousness if you expend
        your mind too much.
        </p>

        <p>
        Some mental abilities, such as "insight" will reveal truths about the world
        if the user can pass certain checks.
