        <p>
        Combat, Conversations, and Conundrums are the three pillars of play that
        this game is designed around. All are treated the same way via the pool
        mechanic. You effectively have three healthbars that interact with these
        three concepts.

        <h5> Conundrums: </h5>

        <p>
        Conundrum are all the puzzles and difficult decisions you encounter during
        play. You can expend mental on thinking really really hard about things,
        potentially at the detriment of your intelligence pool. Thinking too much
        can burn out your brain after all, you will lose consciousness if you expend
        your mind too much.
        </p>

        <p>
        Some mental abilities, such as "insight" will reveal truths about the world
        if the user can pass certain checks.

        <h5> Distance: </h5>

        <p>
        Many spells and abilities have restrictions in the distance they can reach.
        Distances are simplified to a handful of categories as presented below.
        </p>

        <p>
        Longbows are most effective within medium range. Some bows will get damage
        bonuses if you are in nearby range or close range. Trying to aim beyond
        medium range will make the target much more difficult to hit. The difficulty
        of hitting a target increases by 1 for every range step beyond the
        nearby range.
