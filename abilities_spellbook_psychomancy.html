        <h5> Psychomancy: </h5>

        <p>
        Most Psychomancy spells are much less effective on intelligent individuals,
        individuals in combat or similar adrenaline-filled situations, and can be
        broken by strong bursts of emotion or outside influences such as pain. All
        of the below spells affect ONE individual's mind unless otherwise stated.
        </p>

        <p>
        Spells that influence the minds of others can only be successfully used
        on animals and beasts with the trainable "Animal Handling" skill.
        </p>
