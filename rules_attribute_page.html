        Every entity possesses six core attributes. Every roll you make is
        tied to one of these attributes, the higher its value the higher the
        roll is likely to be. A value of 3-5 is considered about average for
        a human in any attribute. A value of 12 is considered the peak of
        natural human ability. Your attributes directly affect your aspect
        pool sizes, which act as health bars. High values in a given
        attribute are required to succeed on difficult rolls, however,
        low values leave one extremely vulnerable.

        <p>
        The six attributes are divided into three groups that represent
        different aspects of an entity. The first of your physical
        attributes is strength, a measure of raw power. The second is
        dexterity, a measure of one’s nimbleness and sleight of hand. Next
        are the intelligence attributes. Acuity is the sharpness of your mind,
        and dictates magical prowess as well as perceptive ability. Memory
        directly relates to the number of abilities and spells you can
        memorize at any given time. The final aspect is charisma, or some
        may call it your soul. It consists of the dual attributes, faith and
        ego. Faith allows one to commune with greater powers than their own,
        and perform magic through holy talismans. Ego allows for more personal
        power and dictates deception and intimidation. Certain rules only
        apply to entities with more faith than ego, and visa versa.
        </p>
        <p>
        Attribute checks are made when your raw natural abilities are tested,
        for example you might be asked to roll a Strength check for trying to
        kick down a hardwood door. For every 3 points in an attribute, add 1d6
        to your roll. Add the remaining attribute points not used to the roll.
        You always roll at least 1d6. Consult the table to the right for an easy
        visualization.

        </table>

        <p>
        Every entity has three aspect pools corresponding to their physique,
        intelligence, and charisma. Every aspect pool is governed by two
        attributes, colors are used to delineate this. Aspect pools act as
        spendable tokens that are lost when you take damage or expend effort.
        Your maximum aspect pool value is calculated by adding the two governed
        attributes. For example, your physical aspect pool would have a maximum
        value equal to your Strength plus your Dexterity value. If you were to
        take two physical damage, you would lose two tokens from your physical
        pool. These could be regained by resting or being healed, but not past
        your maximum.
        </p>
        <p>
        Your Physical Pool acts as a conventional health point total and gets
        reduced as your body takes damage or expend physical effort. Once it
        goes to zero you are in critical condition and begin dying. Without
        outside intervention you will die within a minute. You can draw from
        your physical pool to use certain abilities including dodging blows and
        performing reckless power attacks. Some Strength and Dexterity skills
        can reduce the cost of certain abilities. A short rest of several hours
        can restore 1 token once per day. A long rest of eight hours can
        restore 2 tokens once per day, 3 tokens if the rest was in a notably
        safe and comfortable location.
        </p>
        <p>
        You draw from your Intelligence Pool to use arcane magic and perform a
        number of mental abilities. If it reaches zero you are rendered
        completely unconscious for several hours. Tools such as emblems can
        reduce the cost of particular spells and abilities. Intellect pool
        tokens restore three times faster than physical pool tokens over a rest.
        </p>
        <p>
        Your Charisma Pool can be drawn from for faith based abilities and
        abilities that manipulate conversations,
        once it reaches zero you lose control of your character and the GM
        takes over temporarily. If your character has greater Faith, they
        will become spineless and lose their spirits, doing whatever their
        adversary wants. If your character has greater Ego, they will lose
        control and become irrational, often hostile to other friendly PCs.
        Draining your Charasma Pool may be extremely deadly, or it may be
        harmless depending on the situation.
        </p>

        style="float:right; width:170px;height:150px;margin-right:15px;opacity:60%;">
        <p>
        The three Aspect Pools basically mean you have three health bars,
        and it’s almost guaranteed that every character will have a fatal
        weakness. This makes combat tense and varied. Additionally, it has
        the bonus of treating combat, conversation, and tests of wit all in
        the same way.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is a fourth pool that plays quite differently from the others.
        Your Inspiration Pool has no maximum value and no consequences for
        lowering to zero. Inspiration Pool Points are given sparingly to
        characters by the DM as a reward for nuanced, or badass character
        moments. You may spend 1 Inspiration Pool Point at any time to add a
        d6 to any one roll.

        <p>
        Reference the Attributes and Skills document for all of the skills.
      	Skills all start at the value of zero. They can be increased in various
        ways depending on a character’s natural talents, profession, training,
        and life events. Every skill is associated with a certain Attribute.
        When making a skill check, add the governing Attribute to your skill
        before making the roll. You roll in the exact same manner as you would
        for an Attribute check, consulting the table below.
        </p>
        <p>
        Before a skill check, the DM announces the difficulty of the check.
        Multiply the “difficulty” by two to get the minimum number a player
        must roll. A player may expend effort to decrease the difficulty by one
        level up to two times per skill check. Expending effort means that 1
        point from the relevant pool will be used, emblems do nothing for skill
        checks. Additionally, a different player may expend an effort of their
        own to assist the one making the skill check, lowering the difficulty
        by one level.
        </p>
        <p>
        Example: you want to jump over a large gorge, the DM says you have to
        pass an Acrobatics check with difficulty 6 since it is quite difficult.
        Your acrobatics skill is governed by the Physical Aspect, so you pick
        the higher of the two governing Attributes to use. Add the higher
        Attribute, let’s say a strength value of 7, to your acrobatics skill,
        let’s say 2, to a total of 9. Consulting the below table, a value of 9
        corresponds to rolling 3d6. The difficulty of the check is 6, meaning
        you have to roll a 12 or better with 3d6. There is less than a 50%
        chance of success, so you spend 1 Physical Pool Point to reduce the
        difficulty by 1. Your ally spends 1 Physical Pool Points to assist you
        jumping across the gorge. Now the difficulty is only 4. You need to
        roll 8 or higher with 3d6, now there is closer to a 70% chance of
        succeeding.
